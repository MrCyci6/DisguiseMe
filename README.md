![Options](https://i.ibb.co/SJ9Mwcg/Options.png)
 * You can remove the player's name above his disguise
 * You can customize the name of every mob
 * There are other options, but you shouldn't modify them unless you know what you're doing

![Addons](https://i.ibb.co/QdcGkjv/Addons.png)
* You need a [recent version of Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases) if possible (or [here](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/releases) for MC 1.8)
* [ThatPacketAddon](https://forums.skunity.com/resources/thatpacketaddon.847/) (for packets)
* [Skript-Mirror](https://skripttools.net/dl/skript-mirror+2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) (EntityId, pitch, yaw & packets) (or skript-reflect but I didn't test with it)
* [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) (for packets)

![Bugs](https://i.ibb.co/Jj9pkD7/bugs.png)
Known bugs that cant be fixed or that I don't have the time to fix right now
* The player will have the hitbox of the mob he is disguised as (with physical hit) (unfixable)
* Some mobs use pitch & yaw in a weird way such as Guardians
* Enderdragons face the wrong direction
* Shulkers don't move (They don't move in vanilla)
* In 1.9 & 1.10, rightclicking on a villager can make the clicker crash, and in 1.8 it makes him invisible for the clicker
* Bats look afk, but doing a metadata customization for each mob would be too long
* NPCs are hidden with Citizens2. I can't fix it, just listening to a packet make this (even if I don't modify it)

![Functions](https://i.ibb.co/GdzPPfj/Functions.png)
You can use functions in order to avoid "make console execute command /disguise.." and to disguise some players for others players. See more [here](https://phe0x.fr/DisguiseMe/Functions.html) (ugly but still readable) or read the code
